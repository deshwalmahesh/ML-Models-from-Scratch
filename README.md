# ML-Models-from-Scratch
Repo for ML Models  built from scratch. Includes 
1. Traditional ML: Linear and Logistic Regression, PCA, LDA, SVM etc
2. Deep Learning:
   - Loss with Backprop
   - Activations with BackProp
   - Layers: Dense (Linear), CNN, LSTM, Attention, MultiHead Attention

This code contains the traditional and simpole ML models built using `numpy`, `pandas` and `python 3`. Once in a while `pytorch` is also used for some tasks. There might be some issues but will be solved over time. Not the best of the models but gives good understanding of the problems and helps in deep understanding of the concepts.
